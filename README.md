- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: i started learning coding and electronics sometime in september 2024

I'm going to put all of my projects and just overall stuff on here to be open source and make a portfolio.
I'm am a student so unless it's summer I might have difficulty making projects and expanding my GitHub. I try to as much as possible on here as it's my passion.
The reason I'm writing in English is due to me trying to make everything usable for everyone.
(Põhjus, miks ma inglise keeles kirjutan on, sest ma tahan teha kõike mu kõike kõigile kasutavaks.)
